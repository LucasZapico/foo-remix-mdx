Eos is the enchanting Titan goddess of the dawn in Greek mythology, renowned for her role in opening the gates of heaven each morning to herald the arrival of her brother, Helios, the sun. Daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, and sister to Helios and Selene (the moon), Eos is often depicted with rosy fingers or golden arms, symbolizing the soft light of daybreak.
